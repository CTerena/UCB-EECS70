### concepts
1. **set**: a well defined collection of objects  
     
3. **element/member**: an object in a set  
4. **cardinality(基数/集的势)**: the size of a set  
5. **subset**: if every element of set *A* is also in set *B*, then we say that *A* is a subset of *B*  
6. **proper subset**: set *A* is strictly contained in *B*, meaning that *A* excludes at least one element of *B*  
7. **intersection**: a set containing all elements which are in two or more sets  
8. **disjoint**: two sets are said to be disjoint if their intersection equals to an empty set  
9. **union**: is a set of all elements which are in either on set or both  
10. **complements**: if *A* and *B* are two sets, then the relative complement of *A* in *B*, written as *B - A* or *B\A*, is the set of elements in *B*, but not in *A*.  
11. **cartesian product**(also called the **cross product**): is the set of all pairs whose first component is an element of *A* and whose second component is an element in *B*.
12. **power set**: the set of all subsets of S
