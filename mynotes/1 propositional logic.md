## Propositional Logic  
*Concept 1* **proposition**: a statement which is either true of false  
  
For examples, these statements are all propositions:  
- \sqrt{3} is irrational.    
- 1 + 1 = 5.  
- Li Yang likes touching fish.  
  
On the other hand, these statements aren't propositions:  
- 2 + 2  
- *x*^2^ + 3*x* = 5 [What's *x*?]  
  
Furthermore, these statements aren't propositions either, which can be a little contradictive:   
- Guan Shengzhong often eats in dining hall.  
- Kang Yuyu is popular among girls.  
What we should notice is that **propositions should not include fuzzy terms.**  
  
Next thing, propositions may be joined together to form more complex statements. Let *P*, *Q* and *R* be variables representing propositions. The simplest
way of joiningthese propositions together is to use the connectives "and", "or" and "not."  
      1. **Conjunction**: *P* \bigwedge *Q*(*p* and *Q*). True only when both *P* and *Q* are true.  
      2. **Disjunction**: *P*\bigwee*Q*(*P* or *Q*). True when at least one of P and Q is true.  
      3. **Negation**: \urcorner*P*(not *P*). True when P is false.  
Statements like these, with variables, are called *propositional forms.*  
A fundamental principle known as the **law of the excluded middle** says that, for any proposition *P*, either *P* or \urcorner*P* is true.  
A propositional form that is always true regardless of the truth values of its variables is called a *tautology*.  
Conversely, a statement such as *P* \bigvee\urcorner*P*, which is always false, is called a *contradiction*.
