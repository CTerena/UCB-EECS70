## 1.Proofs  
A **proof** is a finite sequence of steps, called *logical deductions*, which establishes the truth off a desired statement.  

In particular, the power of a proof lies in the fact that using *finite* means, we can guarantee the truth of a statement with *infintely* many cases.  

Recall that there are certain statements, called axioms(公理) and postulates(假设), that we accept without proof.  

## 2.Notations and basic facts:  
$\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of integers.  
$\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of natural numbers.  
These two sets above are closed under addition and multiplication.  

Given integers $a$ and $b$, we say that $a$ divides $b$ (denoted $a|b$) iff there exists an integer $p$ that $b=ap$.   
We use the noatation $:=$ to indicate a definition.  

## 3. Direct Proof
  *Goal*: To prove *P*\Longrightarrow *Q*.  
  *Approach*:  
Assume *P*  
...  
Therefore *Q*
